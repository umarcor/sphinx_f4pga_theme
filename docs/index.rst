    :alt: Material for Sphinx Screenshots

This theme provides a responsive Material Design theme for Sphinx
documentation. It derives heavily from
`Material for MkDocs <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`_,
and also uses code from
`Guzzle Sphinx Theme <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle_sphinx_theme>`_.


Roadmap
-------
`Material for Sphinx <https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material>`_ is a work in progress.  While
I believe that it is ready for use, there are a number of important limitation.  The most
important it to improve the CSS generation to use
`SASS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)>`_. It uses some python to
modify Sphinx output, which is not ideal.

The other issues are:

* improving the documentation;
* providing examples;
* sidebar customization;
* improving the search box; and
* ensuring that all Sphinx blocks work as intended.

You can see how it works on `statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`_.

Getting Started
---------------
Install from git

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material.git

Update your ``conf.py`` with the required changes:

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme = 'sphinx_chipsalliance_theme'


There are a lot more ways to customize this theme. See :ref:`Customization`
or ``theme.conf`` for more details.

.. code-block:: python

    html_theme = 'sphinx_chipsalliance_theme'

    # Material theme options (see theme.conf for more information)
    html_theme_options = {

        # Set the name of the project to appear in the navigation.
        'nav_title': 'Project Name',

        # Set you GA account ID to enable tracking
        'google_analytics_account': 'UA-XXXXX',

        # Specify a base_url used to generate sitemap.xml. If not
        # specified, then no sitemap will be built.
        'base_url': 'https://project.github.io/project',

        # Set the color and the accent color
        'color_primary': 'deep-purple',
        'color_accent': 'indigo',

        # Set the repo location to get a badge with stats
        'github_url': 'https://github.com/project/project/',
        'repo_name': 'Project',

        # Visible levels of the global TOC; -1 means unlimited
        'globaltoc_depth': 3,
        # If False, expand all TOC entries
        'globaltoc_collapse': False,
        # If True, show hidden TOC entries
        'globaltoc_includehidden': False,
    }
